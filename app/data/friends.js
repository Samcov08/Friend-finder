        message: "Chandler is Ross Geller's best friend throughout and since college. He met Ross's sister Monica Geller and her friend Rachel Green while celebrating Thanksgiving 1987 at the Geller family residence during his first year at college. He later moved to apartment #19 in New York City, across the hall from Monica. At some point during this time, Phoebe Buffay moved in with Monica and Kip became Chandler's roommate. Kip and Monica dated for a while, but later broke up, and could no longer stand to be in the same room as each other. Chandler's next roommate, Joey Tribbiani, completed the group of friends. Chandler lived with Joey until season 6, when he moved in with Monica, whom he had been dating for a year.",

She numbers mugs to know which ones are missing. Towels are classified into 11 groups. The most frustrating thing to her friends is when she acts like she’s not obsessed, that she’s just like anybody else. As if anyone else cleans strangers’ cars on the streets.",

        message: "Ross was born to Jack and Judy Geller and raised by them on Long Island, New York. He is the older brother of Monica. When Ross was younger, he dressed up as a woman (with his mother's clothes) and sang, I am Bea / I drink tea / Won't you dance around with me?. Growing up, he attended the same high school as Rachel (as did Monica) where he eventually developed a crush on her and kept it to himself, although Rachel later admitted she knew about his crush. He befriended a student named Will Colbert, who was frequently bullied by Rachel. Dealing with the fact that she never seemed to notice his feelings for her in a very immature way, Ross co-founded an I-Hate-Rachel Club with Will (and a foreign student who didn't know what the club was for). To spite her, the two of them spread a rumor about her that everyone in the entire high school (apart from Rachel herself) heard about, the rumor in question is that she, as Ross put it, had both male and female reproductive parts and that, as Will put it, her parents flipped a coin and decided to raise her as a girl. Even Chandler heard it in his all-boys high school. However, Rachel unknowingly returned the favor in a way after catching Ross making out with Lincoln High School's fifty-year-old librarian. She then spread a rumor regarding this all over the high school (although Ross apparently didn't know that she'd seen him doing this or that everyone in the high school knew about it until many years later)"

        message: "Phoebe was born on February 16 and is the daughter of Frank Buffay and Lily Buffay. Her birth-mother's name was Phoebe Abbott. She has a twin sister named Ursula Buffay, who is also portrayed by Kudrow. Pheobe can speak several languages, including French and Italian. She is a masseuse and musician, notable for her offbeat and extremely ditzy behavior. She was Monica Geller's roommate before Rachel Green, which is how she was introduced to the group. Phoebe is best friends with Monica and Rachel, along with their neighbors, Chandler Bing and Joey Tribbiani, and also Monica's brother Ross Geller. She plays a Gibson Gospel and sings at Central Perk. During the show's ninth season, Phoebe and Joey decide to choose a blind date for each other. Phoebe finds someone for him, but Joey forgets about their deal and doesn't find anyone for her. So a couple minutes before the date, Joey accidentally finds Mike who agrees to go on a blind date with Pheobe. Mike Hannigan, played by actor Paul Rudd and Phoebe begin a romantic relationship. The two later get engaged, then married."

        message: "Joey a food-loving womanizer who has had more luck with dates than any of the other group members. In contrast to his ladies man personality, he has also a marked childish side. He enjoys playing video games and foosball, loves sandwiches and pizza, and is a big fan of Baywatch. As a struggling actor, he is constantly looking for work. He was ordained as a minister in The One with the Truth About London, and officiated at both Monica and Chandler's and Phoebe and Mike's weddings. He does not like sharing food and has difficulty with simple mathematics. In sports, Joey likes the Los Angeles Dodgers and the New York Yankees in baseball, Los Angeles Clippers and New York Knicks in basketball, New York Giants and New York Jets in football, and the Detroit Red Wings and New York Rangers in ice hockey."
